3rd installment of the new CAN and OBDII mapping capabilities. \r\nresolves #893 #870 #869 #871 #186 #172 \r\n\r\nBest way to read this is to start with the CAN_task() function (which replaces the OBD2_task). \r\n\r\nOverall approach: incoming CAN messages are passed through:\r\n\r\n* CAN mapping engine\r\n* OBDII query engine\r\n* and finally queued for consumption by Lua scripts for custom mapping scenarios.\r\n\r\nOf special note, the OBDII query engine:\r\n* optimizes OBDII queries based on configured sample rate\r\n* automatically squelches OBDII channels if the ECU doesn't support a particular PID\r\n\r\nAlso includes quite a bit of refactoring and code clean-up, including:\r\n* a single receiving queue for incoming CAN messages, so only one CAN task is needed to process incoming messages\r\n* an auxiliary CAN queue created to service Lua scripts.

as its value. There are two operational modes:\n+\n+1. When you enable the sensor with minimal configuration, it will query [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/)' nameserver with the URI `myip.opendns.com`, which will resolve to your external IP address. You can use this to get notified if your internet connection has been interrupted and you've been assigned a new IP address.\n+2. If you specify a `hostname`, a regular DNS lookup will be performed, providing you the IP the hostname resolves to.\n+\n+You may also override the nameserver that's being used by setting the `resolver` parameter to any nameserver you like.\n+\n+To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:\n+\n+```yaml\n+# Example configuration.yaml entry\n+sensor:\n+  - platform: dnsip\n+```\n+\n+Configuration variables:\n+\n+- **hostname** (*Optional*): The hostname for which to perform the DNS query.\n+- **resolver** (*Optional*): The DNS server to target the query at.\n+- **ipv6** (*Optional*): Set this to `true` or `false` if IPv6 should be used. Resolving the public IP will resolve to IP of the machine HASS is running on.\n+- **resolver_ipv6** (*Optional*): The IPv6 DNS server to target the query at.\n+- **scan_interval** (*Optional*): Defines number of seconds for polling interval. Default is 120 seconds.\n+\n+#### {% linkable_title Extended example %}\n+\n+```yaml\n+# Example configuration.yaml entry\n+sensor:\n+  # Own public IPv4 address\n+  - platform: dnsip\n+  # IP address of home-assistant.io","path":"source/_components/sensor.dnsip.markdown","position":46,"original_position":46,"commit_id":"0628acedd8574c6addb68985c7e313715ddd5522","original_commit_id":"0628acedd8574c6addb68985c7e313715ddd5522","user":{"login":"danielperna84","id":7396998,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7396998?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84","html_url":"https://github.com/danielperna84","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"Yes.

one of the nice things about running 60+ lootbots has been basically stress testing various things. I have noticed that sometimes random bots will get the \"Failure(0): Lost connection to server\" message. Then when they reconnect it keeps kicking them. Other times ill see one get dc'd and then when it reconnects its fine.  Really really strange. Im wondering if its due to the clients still not sending playerhit/enemyhit/otherhit/squarehit packets? In the nexus there wouldnt be any playerhit or enemyhit packets right? Another player shooting you doesnt trigger the playerhit, right? But what about otherhit? Or squarehit? Does the squarehit packet go out anytime a projectile passes over the square? I need to load up k-relay and do some testing i guess, but any insight would be nice. Im pretty sure this is the reason why random bots are getting dc'd, and other times it might be due to them running way way way too fast, but since i dont have DEBUG_OUTPUT defined im limited to what i have being printed on the screen for me. \r\n\r\nI also really need to work on proper \"Failure\" handling. I did add a part in there that parses the Failure and puts the thread to sleep if it gets the \"Account in use (X seconds until timeout)\" message. But then another message like \"Account has 1 active character in use\" or something, which i dont know if i should put the thread to sleep for 10 minutes or what. I really want to get it set up to handle these and reconnects more smoothly. It seems to almost bruteforce the reconnect at the moment, i have it try to reconnect up to 6 times and then wait 2 minutes if they keep failing. And usually if it fails more then twice it will continue to fail over and over and over. \r\n\r\nThe other error i see sometimes that im not too sure on what it truely means is the client not getting the 5 bytes for the packet header. I have it attempt to do a reconnect when this occurs because otherwise it would throw off the packet data if i read it out of order. I modified how i read the initial 5 bytes in an attempt to prevent this error in the future but i have seen it happen still. Although i think its really just related to the server dc'ing the character for whatever reason, because it will generally be 1 or 2 bytes when i get this error. if 1 byte, its 0xff. if 2 bytes, its usually 0x00 0x00. \r\n\r\nHopefully any errors/bugs in the program i can find and solve during this testing/lootbot phase. I keep forgetting to check the total memory usage after long periods, the cpu for 60+ clients still stays <2% for me (generally around ~1%), but the mem is what im interested in. If theres a memory leak then it should just keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger. But just because the number gets big doesnt always mean theres a leak/problem, if it gets large but then eventually goes back down then that could just mean a lot of data was received and was being stored for a certain amount of time before it was destroyed. Ill try to remember to keep my eye on this.\r\n\r\n\r\nPs. im still surprised at the shit people drop. Ive gotten a few different tops, a fucking etherite dagger lol, and it seems people really dont like st rings as ive gotten a decent amount of those. haha so fun."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/toddw123/RotMG_Clientless/issues/comments/282596525","html_url":"https://github.com/toddw123/RotMG_Clientless/issues/26#issuecomment-282596525","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/toddw123/RotMG_Clientless/issues/26","id":282596525,"user":{"login":"toddw123","id":5315289,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5315289?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123","html_url":"https://github.com/toddw123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-26T23:09:49Z","updated_at":"2017-02-26T23:09:49Z","body":"I get the 0xff or 0x00 0x00 bytes after they are already connected and in game, thats the confusing part.

3rd installment of the new CAN and OBDII mapping capabilities. \\r\\nresolves #893 #870 #869 #871 #186 #172 \\r\\n\\r\\nBest way to read this is to start with the CAN_task() function (which replaces the OBD2_task). \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall approach: incoming CAN messages are passed through:\\r\\n\\r\\n* CAN mapping engine\\r\\n* OBDII query engine\\r\\n* and finally queued for consumption by Lua scripts for custom mapping scenarios.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf special note, the OBDII query engine:\\r\\n* optimizes OBDII queries based on configured sample rate\\r\\n* automatically squelches OBDII channels if the ECU doesn\'t support a particular PID\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso includes quite a bit of refactoring and code clean-up, including:\\r\\n* a single receiving queue for incoming CAN messages, so only one CAN task is needed to process incoming messages\\r\\n* an auxiliary CAN queue created to service Lua scripts.

fetched via DNS resolution, as its value. There are two operational modes:\\n+\\n+1. When you enable the sensor with minimal configuration, it will query [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/)\' nameserver with the URI `myip.opendns.com`, which will resolve to your external IP address. You can use this to get notified if your internet connection has been interrupted and you\'ve been assigned a new IP address.\\n+2. If you specify a `hostname`, a regular DNS lookup will be performed, providing you the IP the hostname resolves to.\\n+\\n+You may also override the nameserver that\'s being used by setting the `resolver` parameter to any nameserver you like.\\n+\\n+To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:\\n+\\n+```yaml\\n+# Example configuration.yaml entry\\n+sensor:\\n+  - platform: dnsip\\n+```\\n+\\n+Configuration variables:\\n+\\n+- **hostname** (*Optional*): The hostname for which to perform the DNS query.\\n+- **resolver** (*Optional*): The DNS server to target the query at.\\n+- **ipv6** (*Optional*): Set this to `true` or `false` if IPv6 should be used. Resolving the public IP will resolve to IP of the machine HASS is running on.\\n+- **resolver_ipv6** (*Optional*): The IPv6 DNS server to target the query at.\\n+- **scan_interval** (*Optional*): Defines number of seconds for polling interval. Default is 120 seconds.\\n+\\n+#### {% linkable_title Extended example %}\\n+\\n+```yaml\\n+# Example configuration.yaml entry\\n+sensor:\\n+  # Own public IPv4 address\\n+  - platform: dnsip\\n+  # IP address of home-assistant.io","path":"source/_components/sensor.dnsip.markdown","position":46,"original_position":46,"commit_id":"0628acedd8574c6addb68985c7e313715ddd5522","original_commit_id":"0628acedd8574c6addb68985c7e313715ddd5522","user":{"login":"danielperna84","id":7396998,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7396998?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84","html_url":"https://github.com/danielperna84","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielperna84/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"Yes.

one of the nice things about running 60+ lootbots has been basically stress testing various things. I have noticed that sometimes random bots will get the \\"Failure(0): Lost connection to server\\" message. Then when they reconnect it keeps kicking them. Other times ill see one get dc\'d and then when it reconnects its fine.  Really really strange. Im wondering if its due to the clients still not sending playerhit/enemyhit/otherhit/squarehit packets? In the nexus there wouldnt be any playerhit or enemyhit packets right? Another player shooting you doesnt trigger the playerhit, right? But what about otherhit? Or squarehit? Does the squarehit packet go out anytime a projectile passes over the square? I need to load up k-relay and do some testing i guess, but any insight would be nice. Im pretty sure this is the reason why random bots are getting dc\'d, and other times it might be due to them running way way way too fast, but since i dont have DEBUG_OUTPUT defined im limited to what i have being printed on the screen for me. \\r\\n\\r\\nI also really need to work on proper \\"Failure\\" handling. I did add a part in there that parses the Failure and puts the thread to sleep if it gets the \\"Account in use (X seconds until timeout)\\" message. But then another message like \\"Account has 1 active character in use\\" or something, which i dont know if i should put the thread to sleep for 10 minutes or what. I really want to get it set up to handle these and reconnects more smoothly. It seems to almost bruteforce the reconnect at the moment, i have it try to reconnect up to 6 times and then wait 2 minutes if they keep failing. And usually if it fails more then twice it will continue to fail over and over and over. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe other error i see sometimes that im not too sure on what it truely means is the client not getting the 5 bytes for the packet header. I have it attempt to do a reconnect when this occurs because otherwise it would throw off the packet data if i read it out of order. I modified how i read the initial 5 bytes in an attempt to prevent this error in the future but i have seen it happen still. Although i think its really just related to the server dc\'ing the character for whatever reason, because it will generally be 1 or 2 bytes when i get this error. if 1 byte, its 0xff. if 2 bytes, its usually 0x00 0x00. \\r\\n\\r\\nHopefully any errors/bugs in the program i can find and solve during this testing/lootbot phase. I keep forgetting to check the total memory usage after long periods, the cpu for 60+ clients still stays <2% for me (generally around ~1%), but the mem is what im interested in. If theres a memory leak then it should just keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger. But just because the number gets big doesnt always mean theres a leak/problem, if it gets large but then eventually goes back down then that could just mean a lot of data was received and was being stored for a certain amount of time before it was destroyed. Ill try to remember to keep my eye on this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPs. im still surprised at the shit people drop. Ive gotten a few different tops, a fucking etherite dagger lol, and it seems people really dont like st rings as ive gotten a decent amount of those. haha so fun."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/toddw123/RotMG_Clientless/issues/comments/282596525","html_url":"https://github.com/toddw123/RotMG_Clientless/issues/26#issuecomment-282596525","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/toddw123/RotMG_Clientless/issues/26","id":282596525,"user":{"login":"toddw123","id":5315289,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5315289?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123","html_url":"https://github.com/toddw123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddw123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-26T23:09:49Z","updated_at":"2017-02-26T23:09:49Z","body":"I get the 0xff or 0x00 0x00 bytes after they are already connected and in game, thats the confusing part.
